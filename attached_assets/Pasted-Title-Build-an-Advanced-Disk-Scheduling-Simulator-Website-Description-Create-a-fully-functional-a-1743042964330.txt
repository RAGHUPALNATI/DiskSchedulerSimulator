Title: Build an Advanced Disk Scheduling Simulator Website

Description:
Create a fully functional and interactive website to simulate and visualize various disk scheduling algorithms:
✅ FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve)
✅ SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
✅ SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
✅ C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)

Users should be able to input custom disk access requests, select scheduling algorithms, and see real-time visualizations of disk head movement. The simulator should include performance metrics like average seek time and system throughput.

Programming Stack
1️⃣ Frontend (User Interface & Visualization):
✅ Language: JavaScript
✅ Framework: React.js (with Vite for fast development)
✅ Styling: Tailwind CSS (for a modern and responsive UI)
✅ Visualization: D3.js or Chart.js (for graphical representation of disk head movement)

2️⃣ Backend (Algorithm Processing & API):
✅ Language: Python
✅ Framework: Flask (lightweight and efficient for API handling)
✅ Libraries: NumPy (for seek time calculations)

3️⃣ Deployment & Hosting:
✅ Frontend Hosting: Vercel or Netlify
✅ Backend Hosting: Render or Heroku

Key Features & Functionalities
🔹 User Input Form:

Fields for disk size, initial head position, and request queue.

Dropdown to select the scheduling algorithm.

🔹 Disk Scheduling Algorithm Implementation (Python – Flask API):

FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN implemented using Python functions.

API endpoint to process disk scheduling and return computed seek times & sequences.

🔹 Real-Time Visualization (JavaScript – React + D3.js):

Animate disk head movement dynamically.

Display seek sequence graphically.

🔹 Performance Analysis (Python – Flask & Chart.js):

Compute average seek time for each algorithm.

Compare seek times in a bar chart.

Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
✅ Step 1: Set up React project (npm create vite@latest disk-scheduler)
✅ Step 2: Install dependencies (npm install chart.js d3 tailwindcss axios)
✅ Step 3: Implement disk scheduling algorithms in Flask and expose API endpoints
✅ Step 4: Build a React-based input form for user interaction
✅ Step 5: Implement visualization with D3.js for disk movement
✅ Step 6: Display performance metrics using Chart.js
✅ Step 7: Deploy the frontend (Vercel/Netlify) and backend (Render/Heroku)

Additional Enhancements (Optional but Recommended)
🔹 Dark mode toggle for better user experience.
🔹 Downloadable reports with seek times and visualizations.
🔹 Live API to fetch real-world disk scheduling data (if available).

Expected Output:
A fully interactive web-based disk scheduling simulator, allowing users to:

Enter custom disk access requests.

Select and run disk scheduling algorithms.

View animated disk movement.

Compare performance of FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN.
